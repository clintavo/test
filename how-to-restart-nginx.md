# How to restart NGINX

## Retart the service

restarting is easy

```
$ sudo service nginx restart
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This will briefly take NIGNIX offline.  You can also you the reload option if you just need to pickup a changed configuration.
{% endhint %}

To reload instead:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
